The raw data for this project was provided by the BioCircuits Institute at the University of California - San Diego for the purpose of research.

The data set contains 13,910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors that were exposed to 6 different gases (Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, Toluene) of varying concentration levels. The data was gathered over 36 months in a gas delivery platform facility at the ChemoSignal Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute.
